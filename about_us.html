        <h1>About Us</h1>

        <p>
            We are a collective of people with diverse backgrounds and political experiences based in Dresden.
            What brought us together is the struggle for Palestinian liberation, and what keeps us together is a
            shared commitment to anti colonial and anti imperialist principles, a culture of care, and a community
            where people can speak and learn freely.
        </p>

        <p>
            We organize in a context where Palestinian voices are often silenced, and where complicity in the ongoing
            genocide in Palestine is normalized. In Rumman we found a space where we can act, listen and support one
            another without censorship.
        </p>

        <p>
            We work to challenge harmful narratives and create accessible spaces for dialogue, collective learning,
            and political action. Our activities include demonstrations, educational events, community gatherings,
            and collaborations with local and international groups.
        </p>

        <p>
            We aim to build a political culture that centers the voices of the oppressed, exposes the connections
            between the German state and the violence in Palestine, and contributes to broader struggles for justice
            and liberation.
